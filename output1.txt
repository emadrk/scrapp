Important Points for JEE Main Eligibility Criteria
 
 
Further, candidates who have passed 12th or equivalent exam in 2020, 2021 or appearing in 2022 are eligible.
 
Also, candidates must have passed 12th from a recognized central or state board.
 
Candidates who have passed 12th from 
NIOS
 must have studied a minimum of five subjects.
 
There are no criteria on pass percentage in the qualifying exam to write JEE Main. Yet, for admissions into the IITs, NITs, IIITs and CFTIs, candidates need a certain score. In all, they need an aggregate score of 75% in the qualifying exam (65% for SC/ST/PwD categories).
 
 
Subjects required in 10+2
 
This criterion does not limit a candidate from appearing in JEE Main 2022. The participating colleges of JEE Main want these bucket of subjects in class 12th-
 
 
JEE Main
 
Paper 1 – B.Tech/B.E.
 
 
Physics
 
Mathematics
 
Anyone of subjects including Chemistry, Biology, Biotechnology or Technical Vocational Subject
 
 
 
JEE Main Paper 2 – B.Arch.
 
 
Physics
 
Chemistry
 
Mathematics
 
 
 
JEE Main Paper 3 – B.Planning
 
 
Mathematics
 
 
 
 
With this under consideration, it is evident that now B.E/B.Tech course does not need Chemistry as the main subject. Although, colleges might still consider this under admission criteria.

 this time to rank the candidates after compiling the JEE result of all sessions.
 
This is to ensure balanced competition among candidates appearing for JEE Main 2022.
 
 
What Factors Can Change JEE Main 2022 Cut Off?
 
The following factors play a crucial role in determining the JEE Main Cut Off every year-
 
 
A total number of candidates appeared for the exam 
– If the total number of candidates increases every year, the number of candidates scoring higher will increase as well. The JEE Main Cutoff will increase in this case.
 
Level of difficulty of the exam 
– JEE Main Cut Off for Counselling is majorly depending on the level of difficulty. This is why JEE Main Cutoff has decreased in recent years.
 
The number of available seats
 – Every year there are multiple intakes in Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and Government Funded Technical Institutions (GFTIs). If the number of colleges increase or decrease, or if the batch size is increased, compared to the number of applicants, JEE Main Cut Off will increase or decrease as well.
 
Overall performance of the candidate
 – If a large number of applicants perform very well in JEE Main, the cutoff is subject to increment.
 
 
JEE Main Cut Off Trends: 2016 to 2020
 
The JEE Main Cut Off decides your eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced 2022 which will further give you the chance to join the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

JEE Main Counselling 2022
 
The centralized counselling process for JEE Main 2022 conducted for IITs and other engineering colleges. Seat Allocation in the institutes participating in the centralized process will be based on AIR and candidate preferences for branch and institute. 
JEE Main Counselling
 will be done at four levels in online mode:
 
 
Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA)
:
 IITs, IIITs, NITs, IIEST Shibpur and other Government Funded Technical Institutes.
 
CSAB Special Rounds:
 For NIT+ system colleges, if seats left vacant after JoSAA Counselling.
 
CSAB-NEUT
:
 AICTE approved institutes in North-East States & UTs.
 
CSAB-SFTI
:
 Counselling for 17 Self-funded Technical Institutes.
 
 
Difference Between JoSAA and CSAB
 
Initially, the counselling for AIEEE (now JEE Main) was conducted by CCB or Central Counselling Board. With structure of exams changing from 2013, to JEE Main and JEE Advanced, CCB was also renamed 
CSAB (Central Seat Allocation Board)
.
 
 
But from 2015-16, 
JoSAA or Joint Seat Allocation Authority
 was setup to conduct the joint counselling for IITs, NITs, IIITs and GFTIs. This was done in order to keep the process simple for students who appeared for both JEE Main and JEE Advanced.
 
Currently, CSAB handles counselling for few specific types – CSAB NEUT and CSAB Special Rounds. CSAB Special Round counselling is conducted only when there are vacant seats after all rounds of JoSAA Counselling are completed.
 
 
Seat Acceptance Procedure
 
 
Payment of Fees and Seat Acceptance:
 After the seat allotment, candidates will have to choose one of the following options: 
 
Freeze:
 Candidates who are satisfied with the allotted seat and course and do not wish to participate in the JEE Main Counselling process any further, may choose this option.
 
Float:
 Those candidates who want to keep the allotted seat but also wish to upgrade their seat (or course), may choose this option. This will take you for further rounds of JEE Main Counselling 2020.
 
Slide:
 Those candidates who wish to keep the allotted seat in the same institute/college but would like to upgrade the course to a higher-ranked course can choose this option.
 
Withdraw:
 Candidates who have been allotted a seat under a course of preferred college but now do not want admission can withdraw their seat by informing the same to the institute before the last date of seat allotment.
 
 
 
Document Verification:
 The documents have to be verified during the reporting at colleges. This can be conducted uploading and reporting online.
 
Final Reporting:
 After the verification of documents, candidates will have to report to the allotted institute and they will have to pay the balance fee as per the college course rules. In case a candidate does not report at college till the last date, the seat will be cancelled.
 
 
 
 
JEE Main 2022 Participating Colleges
 
More than 100 colleges take part in the counselling process of JEE Main. In order to score admission in top IIT courses, candidates need to clear JEE Advanced 2022 as well. But before that, candidates need to get a rank in the top 2,50,000 qualifiers of the JEE Main exam to be eligible for the JEE Advanced 2022.
 
 
But maybe it is good to have contingencies, and that is why it would be considered a smart move if you have knowledge of good institutes other than just the IITs.
 
There are many private as well as government-funded institutes that provide admissions based on the 
JEE Main
 scores.
 
Various institutes like NITs, IITs, IIITs, GFTIs and major state-funded colleges allot their seats on the basis of JEE Main scores.
 
Now, seats in many private colleges are also filled using the scores of JEE Main only.
 
Although there are a few colleges such as BITS Pilani which conduct their own exam (
BITSAT
) for admissions to their top courses.
 
 
Candidates are advised to check the 
JoSAA Counselling
 
process to ensure that they do not commit any mistakes.
 
 
 
Top Engineering Colleges in India
 
Now that the JEE Main 2022 is coming closer, students are getting prepared for admissions to top engineering colleges in India. Students still prefer engineering in higher education due to its vast scope in the global industry.
 
 
As per the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2022, Engineering Rankings, 8 IITs and 2 NIT rank in top 10 colleges.
 
This year also, IIT Madras has topped the first position, with IIT Delhi on 2nd and IIT Bombay on 3rd.
 
NIT Tiruchirappalli & NIT Karnataka are the only NITs to rank under top 10 colleges. It is at 9th & 10th position this year.
 
 
Given below is the list of top 10 engineering colleges in India as per NIRF 2021 Ranking:
